extensive balance sheet flexibility enscorowanand particularly -pron- shareholdershave pay for this flexibility when other driller utilize -pron- flexibility earlier in the cycle to increase leverage and add layer of debt enscorowan sell equity and convertible bond in fact enscorowan be the only tier one driller that have issue equity and equity link debt since 2011 outside of a corporate transaction or bankruptcy in total enscorowan have issue 1 5 billion in equity and convertible bond and 1 4 billion in equity consideration in the rowan merger additionally enscorowan prioritize creditor follow the rowan acquisition by provide corporate guarantee on assume debt rather than allow a low priority layer of debt to exist within -pron- capital structure in -pron- opinion the low priority would have weigh on bond price and open more lucrative opportunity for equity accretive liability management these action while consistent with enscorowans long term aspiration to return to investment grade have prioritize creditor at a cost to equity give -pron- view that the benefit of investment grade status be at a minimum five year away -pron- believe these action to improve the

announce a liability management bond tender in the near term assume enscorowan fund this tender with new bond those bond be likely to contain covenant and restriction that will constrain the company for many year to come in light of the disproportionate underperformance of the equity versus the bond the relative cost of capital between equity and senior unsecured debt have shift dramatically follow this significant repricing of enscorowans security -pron- believe that the company must reconsider the broad available range of option and shift the capital structure away from extremely high cost equity and towards low cost debt have become essential recommendation enscorowans stock value have decouple from the fundamental strength of the business and the stock be trade at a significant

fiscally responsible way and ensure that shareholder still benefit from the ultimate industry recovery the cost of pay the dividend be limit ultimately the companys long term target of achieve investment grade status would be defer but -pron- ability to achieve all the rest of -pron- objective would be retain enscorowans stock be trade like an out of the money call option on asset value the ensco rowan merger be approve on february 21 2019 from that time through june 7 2019 enscorowans stock price have decline by approximately 56 underperforming peer and the broad oilfield service market by approximately 26 and 32 respectively in -pron- opinion the market have clearly show -pron- will treat enscorowans stock like an option rather than as equity of a viable long term company this be clearly demonstrate on friday may 17 2019 after the company announce an unexpected 180 million arbitration award from samsung heavy industries despite the disclosure of a highly probable cash inflow equal to almost 10 of the companys market capitalization the equity fail to respond an announcement of that magnitude in a traditional equity would have see a more commensurate improvement of -pron- stock price in -pron- opinion the only way this award could have be broadly ignore by the market be if investor believe the money would not accrue to equitys benefit and that the esv equity option would not benefit from the award enscorowans balance sheet be misunderstood -pron- believe that investor mistakenly view enscorowans balance sheet as a source of weakness barclays 3 5 2019 esv rdc

esv ne the former have good balance sheet give -pron- a long runway for the recovery to take hold esv and ne on the other hand have less time before thing get good with loom debt maturity in 24 26 btig 5 30 2019 -pron- believe esv steeper discount on an imply value per rig be a function of balance sheet concern however enscorowan have extensive flexibility and optionality around -pron- balance sheet that be likely not be appreciate by the market and be not available to many of the companys peer enscorowan have maintain this flexibility through the cycle by conservatively capitalize with equity by issue equity and convertible bond total 1 5 billion since 2011 and by issue 1 4 billion in equity consideration in the rowan merger incremental debt capacity enscorowans bond indenture provide the company with very significant flexibility to raise additional debt fund operation manage liability and pay dividend revolver aside all of enscorowans outstanding bond have light investment grade style covenant package which include no limitation on dividend and allow for significant amount of structurally senior debt to be issue therefore for the purpose of this analysis -pron- conservatively assume that enscorowan will terminate -pron- revolver in -pron- place -pron- assume that enscorowan will utilize -pron- significant capacity for first money out paper similar to transocean ltd s priority guarantee and noble corps senior guarantee bond hereafter refer to as priority guarantee debt enscorowan have not tap into any of these various capacity or utilize these

primary type of asset drillship semisubmersible and jackup enscorowan also own 50 of the aro drilling joint venture with saudi aramco -pron- have estimate enscorowans debt capacity use the follow metric drillships pacific drilling raise just over 1 billion in secured debt in september 2018 against 7 drillship at an implied debt rig of 150 million and an average cash cost at issuance just over 9 these bond currently trade near par imply that these term be currently on market also noteworthy be the fact that pacd have very limit contract coverage on -pron- asset at the time of issuance highlight that this debt capacity be base on asset value and not cash flow enscorowans drillship cost on average 687 million per rig to construct per ihs and recent transaction imply drillship value in the 300 350 million range enscorowan have 16 drillship of good quality on average than pacific drilling in -pron- opinion or 14 net of two already encumber newbuild in the shipyardfor an implied debt capacity of 2 1 billion semisubmersibles enscorowan have two 6th generation semisubmersible rig seven 8500 series rig deliver in 2008 and later three be work four be cold stack and three old semisubmersible enscorowans 6th generation rig cost on average 688 million per rig to construct and the three active 8500 series rig cost 492 million per rig to construct per ihs a conservative approach would be to assume 100 million of debt on each of the 6th generation rig and 50 million on each of the three work 8500 series rig this would represent an additional 350 million in debt capacity jackups borr drilling in march 2019 obtain a 160 million bank facility secure by mortgage over four jackup rig and a separate 120 million bank facility secure by mortgage over two jackup rig these transaction imply 40 60 million in debt per modern jackup which be likely a conservative debt capacity benchmark as the bank market be typically more conservative with respect to loan to value than bond market enscorowans 36 jackup deliver in 2000 or later include 15 harsh environment capable rig cost on average 211 million per rig to construct per ihs and modern jackup transaction be now over 85 million per rig have trough at around 65 million assume no debt capacity exist against the companys old jackup and 45 million per rig of debt capacity against the new jackup this fleet represent an additional 1 62 billion in debt capacity aro drilling joint venture enscorowan be a 50 50 partner with saudi aramco the world large jackup customer which also have an a a1 credit rating
